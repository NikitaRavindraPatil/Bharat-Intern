3. Netflix Homepage:
   In this project, a basic, non-functional web page is designed to emulate the visual layout of the Netflix homepage. The static page encompasses a header, prominent features, frequently asked questions (FAQs), contact details, and an 
   email subscription form. It's important to note that this replication is simplified and lacks functional elements such as user authentication or streaming capabilities.
